# Clinton Emails

Tools to download and analyze emails provided by Hillary Clinton to the State Department.

### Context

â€‹In December 2014, former Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton provided the U.S. Department of State with emails that were sent or received by her while she was Secretary of State.

The State Department is in the midst of conducting a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) review of all emails provided by former Secretary Clinton. Beginning in June 2015, a new corpus of emails from this collection will be published at the end of every month. These monthly releases are to continue until the entire corpus is reviewed for public release. All releasable records will be available as PDFs on the [FOIA site](https://foia.state.gov/Learn/New.aspx).

### Overview

The code contained in this repo can be used to download the PDFs distributed by the State Department, extract plain text from those PDFs, and store that text in a database for use when performing analysis.

To get started, create a new virtual environment and install the included requirements:

```python
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
